We named our service Babpool because we want to create a tight-knit university community, a pool of connections that can always be there to help.

You know how hard it is to make connections at university - it's hard to make friends if you don't start making friends at the beginning of the term, or if you don't join a club. Even when you get to university and start exploring fields outside of your major, it's hard to get useful information if you don't know anyone in that field. With this in mind, we wanted to create an opportunity for people to sign up for a rice pill, or rice appointment, on campus to have a one-on-one conversation with people who share their interests and goals, regardless of their major or club.
